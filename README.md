## Rebase:
Git rebase is a command used to integrate changes from one branch into another. Unlike merge, which creates a new "merge commit," rebase rewrites the commit history to create a linear sequence of commits.

In simpler terms, rebasing moves the branch youâ€™re working on to the tip of another branch, replaying your commits on top of it.

Why Use Git Rebase?
Clean History: Rebasing avoids creating merge commits, resulting in a cleaner, linear history.
Integration: Useful for incorporating updates from the main branch into your feature branch.
